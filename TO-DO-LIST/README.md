## 🧾 Overview

This repository contains the task submissions for my Python internship at *CodSoft*.  
The internship is designed to provide hands-on experience by building small projects that focus on programming fundamentals, logic development, and structured problem-solving using Python.

Each task reflects the understanding of a specific concept or application area and is presented with organized code and output samples wherever applicable.

---

## 📚 Objective

The goal of this internship is to:
- Strengthen my foundational knowledge of Python.
- Practice solving real-world problems through code.
- Build a habit of writing structured, readable, and maintainable code.
- Understand the basics of project structure and task separation.

## 📁 Task List

Below are the tasks included in this internship:

### 1. 📝 To-Do List  
A task manager that allows users to add, update, delete, and clear tasks. Built with a graphical interface using Tkinter.

### 2. 🧮 Calculator  
A basic calculator application that performs arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### 3. 🔐 Password Generator  
Generates secure, random passwords based on user-defined criteria like length and character types.

### 4. ✊ Rock Paper Scissors  
A simple game where the user competes with the computer in a best-of-one match using the classic rules.

### 5. 📒 Contact Book  
A program that stores and manages contact information, allowing users to add, search, update, and delete entries.

# To-Do List

This is a simple To-Do List application built using Python. It helps users manage daily tasks with options to add, update, delete, and clear items from the list.

The interface is created using the tkinter module, with a basic window icon set through the included icon.ico file.

## ✅ Features

- Add new tasks
- Update existing tasks
- Delete selected task
- Clear all tasks
- Scrollable task display
- Custom window icon using icon.ico

---

## 🛠 Built With

- Python
- Tkinter (Python’s standard GUI library)

---

## 📁 Files Included

- todo.py – Main Python script
- icon.ico – Icon file for the application window
- README.md – Project documentation

---

##  How to Use

If you'd like to try the application:

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Open the folder that contains the project files.
3. Run the program by opening todo.py.

No additional setup is required. The interface will open in a window, and you can begin adding your tasks right away.
