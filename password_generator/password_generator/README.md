# 🔐 Password Generator App (PyQt5)

This is a user-friendly **Password Generator Application** built using **Python** and **PyQt5**.  
It allows users to generate **strong, random passwords** with customizable length and complexity — essential for improving online security.

This project was developed as **Task 3** during my **CodSoft Python Internship**.

## 📌 Project Description

The Password Generator app is designed to help users create secure passwords based on their preferences.  
Users can enter the desired password length, and the application will generate a secure password using a mix of:

- Uppercase letters (A–Z)
- Lowercase letters (a–z)
- Numbers (0–9)
- Special characters (!, @, #, etc.)

The app uses the `random` module to ensure each password is unique and unpredictable. The graphical user interface is built using **PyQt5**, providing an interactive and responsive user experience.
